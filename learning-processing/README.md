# Learning Processing

ðŸ¤– Computer Science for Designers   
ðŸ¤– SS 20   
ðŸ¤– Taught by Ido Iurgel and Thomas Laubach (HSRW)   

The class used the book "Learning Processing" by Daniel Shifman and further exercises as the foundation. The final outcome was a blog with all results. I discontinued the blog and moved my sketches to GitHub instead. They are not in chronological order anymore but I tried to sort them logically.
